## How do I create a menu?

This can be as simple as describing your menu with with plain JavaScript data structures. This example adds two top menus "Stuff" and "Misc." each with their own submenu.

Please note that in macOS apps the first item of a menu is always the default application menu named after the application name and with the default submenu. This *can* be changed but requires extra work.
